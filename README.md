# ASU CryptoRally Ciphers Encryption and Decryption Code (Currently in Python 2.7)
Compilation of code I wrote in preparation for the ASU CryptoRally competition (https://math.asu.edu/cryptorally2019)

The ASU CryptoRally is an event on the Arizona State University campus that promotes interest in topics such as Discrete Mathematics, Cryptography, and Computer Science.

At the competition, teams use programmable calculators, pencil, pen, and paper to decrypt cipher text prepared from one of several different ciphers.

The message contained in each cipher text indicates the location of the next cipher text in the scavenger hunt across the ASU campus.

I participated in the ASU CryptoRally in 2016, 2017, and 2018. I placed 2nd in 2017 and 1st in 2018.

I wrote most of this code during my sophomore year of high school in 2016.

NOTE: This is not the code I used on the day of the competition. That code was written on a TI-nspire calculator in the TI-nspire Basic language. However, the TI-nspire code I used has very similar algorithms to the ones in this repository.
